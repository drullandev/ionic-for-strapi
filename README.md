# Ionic React Conference Application


This application was based in the nice kitchen-sink demo of the Ionic Framework and React.

**Now must be fully based on a backoffice system. ** In my case, I was performig over Strapi, being a fightfull tool to do great thinks in a flexible and fast winfdow time overfeaturing scope.

## This is a REACT + TYPESCRIPT version. Also I added other features, among the most usefull

- Strapi connected (is my back, then, choose your preferred)
- React
- Ionic
- TypeScript
- Axios
- Redux


## The backoffice part is over my privated project but... could be easy to go just having this clean preview over the project code and adapt the models/interfaces to your use. I know is a hard work then, I can share some structural info by PV if someone have an especific curiosity or wanna collaborate in a professional relationship

BY NOW is a WIP, but I will be continue with this repo on fire until the success end of the core for a future projects

You know, I'm not exacly looking for help, while I recognise this matter only will be used by me to set life to my first creatures. But at least I wanna share this nive prove of work in my free time ^_^. Maybe can help to demonstrate I'm concerned and hardly interested in learn to offer strong React features and a nice boilerplate.

Thanks to read! ;)
